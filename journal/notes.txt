Today : making boulders 

Questions : How should combat behavior be defined? Should the dood shoot/combat only in the 
		forward direction OR should he be able to shoot/combat in other directions? 

	    How should out of combat action moves work (e.g. when shooting boulders? ) 
	
	    More to the point: How should movement work? Does he actually face left/right when he moves?
		or does he always face forward / backward? 

New : 
	- created a new removable class for objects that can be removed from the board if something hits them enough times
	- created boulders (extends removable)
	- incorporated removable objects into the game loop (note that removable objects must always be added BEFORE nonremovable ones
		to the collidable objects list ) 
	- 

Changes : 
	- added a constants.py file . it contains all the module/game-level constants 

	- a new beam is shot only at key_up rather than key_down (i.e. if you hold down spacebar, only one beam fires
		instead of multiple beams as before)

	- 

TODO : 
	- add a facing-direction attribute for player (right now the direction he is facing is defaulted to fwd when firing
		laser beams if no movement has been made for one game loop _
